# Tron

 I just discovered tilemaps ! I need to start from the beginning  
 as it'll make the WHOLE IA system WAY easier to manage!  
 I guess, I don't I have to see how to use it

 Tron game made with Unity (2022.3.2f1 LTS) for school project

 You will need the following packages to build :
    * TMP Essential (it pops up on Unity's launch) 
    * Post processing
